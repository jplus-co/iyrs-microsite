Nathalie Miebach explores the intersection of art and science by translating scientific data related to meteorology, ecology and oceanography into woven sculptures and musical scores and installations. Using both digital technologies and traditional crafts, Miebach examines how these two approaches can be used to eek out a more nuanced expression and understanding of information.
