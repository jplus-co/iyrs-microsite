Traditional tools, methods and technology are utilized as resources in contemporary design. Miebach will discuss how tradition and technology mix into a questioning and conceptual partnership within her sculptural work. And, her belief in the importance of combining the long-established, hand-build techniques with todayâ€™s computer-enhanced data collection and music generation.
